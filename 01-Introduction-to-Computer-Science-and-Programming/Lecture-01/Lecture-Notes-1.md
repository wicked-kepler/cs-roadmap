# Lecture 1 - Introduction to Python

> **Topic Overview:** knowlege, machines, objects, variables, bindings

### Types of knowledge
- **Declerative knowledge** - statements of facts
- **Imperative knowledge** - instructions

### Algorithms
- Sequence of simple steps
- Flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed
- A means of determining when to stop

### Types of programs
- **Fixed program computer** - fixed set of algorithms
- **Stored program computer:**
- Sequence of instructions stored inside computer
- Built from predefined set of primitive instructions
- Special program (interpreter) executes each instruction in order

### Basic primitives
- Turing showed that you can computer anything with a simple machine with only 6 primitives:
left, right, print, scan, erase and no operation
- Real programming languages have:
  - More convenient set of primitives
  - Ways to combine primitives to create new primitives
- Any computable in one language is computable in any other programming language

### Aspects of language
- **Syntax** - grammar of a langauge
- **Static semantic** - syntactically correct but have no meaning

### Programs
- **Program** - a sequence of definitions and commands
- **Commands** - instructs interpreter to do something

### Objects
- Programs manipulate data objects
- Objects have a type that defines the kinds of things programs can do to them
- **Scalar** - cannot be subdivided e.g. number
- **Non-scalar** - have international structure that can be accessed e.g. list, strings

### Programs
- Programs only do what you tell them to do
- Lines of code are executed in order
- Good variable names and comments help you read code later
