# Lecture 3 - Loops and Iteration Methods

> **Topic Overview:** control flow, loops

### Looping mechanisms
- You can loop over:
  - a range of numbers
  - elements in a string
- It is a way to repeat things multiple times without having the repeat code

### For loops
- for loops have pre-specified range over which they run
- ``` for i in range(x): ```
  - i goes from 0 to x-1
- ``` for char in s: ```
  - char is a string that takes on the value of each character in s
 
### While loops
- while loops ahve a condition that they check to determine if they should keep running
- They keep running until the condition no longer evaluates to True
- ```
  counter = 0
  while counter < 3:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
  ```
