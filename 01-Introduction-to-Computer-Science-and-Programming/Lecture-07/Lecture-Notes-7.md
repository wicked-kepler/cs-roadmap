# Lecture 7 - Decomposition, Abstraction and Functions

> **Topic Overview:** decomposition, abstraction, specifications

### Abstraction
- Hide tedious coding details from the user
- Reuse sections of code through functions

### Decomposition
- Decomposition is used to divide code into modules that are:
  - Self-contained
  - Intended to be reusable
- Modules are used to:
  - Break up code into logical pieces
  - Keep code organised
  - Keep code coherent

### Functions
- Functions or procedures are reusable pieces of code
- A function will produce an output from inputs, while hiding details of how it does the computation
- Docstrings can be used to highlights specifications of a function
- Compared to code in a file it doesn't run when you load the file only when it is called
